# Blood-Group-Detection-Using-Fingerprint
A deep learning project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict a personâ€™s blood group from fingerprint images. Built with PyTorch and Flask, this web app allows users to upload fingerprint images and get instant blood group predictions.

# Features
- Uses CNN to analyze fingerprint images.
- Supports 8 blood group classes.
- Includes training, validation, and testing pipeline.
- Web interface for uploading fingerprint images and getting predictions.
- Confusion matrix and performance metrics visualization.
